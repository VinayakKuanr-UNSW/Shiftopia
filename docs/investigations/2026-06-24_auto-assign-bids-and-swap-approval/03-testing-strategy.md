# 03 — Testing Strategy (Auto-Assign Bids refactor + Auto-Approve Swaps)

**Status:** Authoritative QA plan. Binds to [00-contracts-and-conventions.md](00-contracts-and-conventions.md) (canonical names, enums §6, idempotency §5, gateway contract §2), [01-auto-assign-bids-refactor.md](01-auto-assign-bids-refactor.md) (the 10 mandatory fixes §3, fairness §4, concurrency §5, API §8, rollback §9), [02-auto-approve-swaps.md](02-auto-approve-swaps.md) (decision matrix §2, eligibility §3, abuse prevention §4, queue §1.2), and the [audit](AUDIT.md) (§3 logical audit, §4 32-row failure table, §11 existing 54 cases). This document **extends** the audit's 54 cases — it does not duplicate them verbatim.

**Scope of binding-doc corrections honoured here:** per 01 §"Binding-doc corrections", the gateway is `sm_apply_shift_op(p_shift_id, p_expected_version, p_op, p_payload, p_idempotency_key uuid)` with **no `p_actor`** (actor = `auth.uid()`), `get_shift_fsm_state` is **6-arg** (incl. `bidding_status`), `select_winner` is legal at **S5/S6 only**, and the gateway idempotency key is a **uuid** matched against `shift_events.metadata->>'idem'`. All test expectations below use those corrected forms.

**Total test cases in this document: 180** (IDs `AU-*`, `MF-*`, `SE-*`, `DM-*`, `IA-*`, `IS-*`, `CC-*`, `SEC-*`, `LS-*`, `FR-*`). Minimum-count floors per group are all exceeded.

## 0. Test pyramid, tooling, and harness conventions

### 0.1 Pyramid

```
            ╱╲          Load/Scale (LS-*)  + Failure-recovery (FR-*)   — 18 cases  P0/P1
           ╱  ╲         run on a dedicated Supabase test project + k6/autocannon
          ╱----╲        Security (SEC-*) + Concurrency (CC-*)          — 22 cases  P0
         ╱      ╲       integration against the test project + pgTAP for SQL races
        ╱--------╲      Integration (IA-* bids, IS-* swaps)            — 20 cases  P0/P1
       ╱          ╲     Edge Function ↔ gateway ↔ audit tables, real Postgres
      ╱------------╲    Unit (AU-*, MF-*, SE-*, DM-*)                  — 72 cases  P0
     ╱______________╲   vitest, pure functions, in-memory, deterministic, no I/O
```

The base is broad and cheap: the **decision brain is pure** by design (`runBidSelection`/`selectBids`/`scoreAllBids` are pure — [01 §1.2](01-auto-assign-bids-refactor.md); `evaluateEligibility` is "a deterministic pure function" — [02 §3](02-auto-approve-swaps.md)). Almost every fairness/scoring/eligibility/matrix guarantee is therefore a **vitest unit** with no database. Concurrency, RLS, SECURITY-DEFINER authz, and the queue need a **real Postgres** (the test Supabase project) and **pgTAP** for the SQL-level race/guard assertions. Load lives at the apex.

### 0.2 Test runners & where each layer runs

| Layer | Runner | Target | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Unit (AU/MF/SE/DM) | **vitest** (`npm run test` → `vitest run`, [package.json](../../package.json)) | in-memory | Matches existing `src/modules/**/__tests__/*.test.ts` style ([shift-op-legality.test.ts](../../src/modules/rosters/domain/__tests__/shift-op-legality.test.ts), [fairness-ledger.test.ts](../../src/modules/rosters/domain/__tests__/fairness-ledger.test.ts)). `describe`/`it`/`expect`, pure imports. **ESLint is broken in this repo — gates are `tsc --noEmit` + `vitest` + `build`** (project memory). |
| Integration (IA/IS) | **vitest** + `@supabase/supabase-js` (service-role + a seeded manager JWT) | **Supabase test project** (a *branch* of prod created via `mcp__supabase__create_branch`, never prod `srfozdlphoempdattvtx`) | The Edge Functions `auto-assign-bids` / `auto-approve-swaps` are deployed to the test branch; tests invoke them with `functions.invoke` and assert on `assignment_*`/`swap_*` rows + shift `version`/state. |
| SQL guards & races (CC/SEC SQL rows) | **pgTAP** (`pgtap` extension; run with `pg_prove`) | test branch | One `.sql` file per RPC: `sm_apply_shift_op`, the hardened `sm_select_bid_winner`, `sm_assignment_run_rollback`, `sm_swap_auto_decide`, `enqueue_swap_auto_decision`. pgTAP gives transactional `SELECT throws_ok/results_eq/is` assertions and lets two sessions race inside `BEGIN` blocks. No pgTAP exists in the repo yet — this plan introduces `supabase/tests/` as the home for it. |
| Load (LS) | **k6** (HTTP, for Edge invocations) + a SQL seed script | test branch sized to prod-like volume | p95 latency, queue drain time, DLQ rate. |

### 0.3 Faking the clock for TTS (the 4h lock)

The 4h time-lock (`tts_seconds = EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (scheduled_start - now()))`, [00 §3](00-contracts-and-conventions.md)) is tested **two ways**:

- **Unit / TS side** — mock `Date.now` exactly as the existing suites do ([bidding-urgency.test.ts:23](../../src/modules/rosters/domain/__tests__/bidding-urgency.test.ts)): `vi.spyOn(Date, 'now').mockReturnValue(...)` then `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`. Engine-side TTS checks (the eligibility 4h rule §3, the engine's `SKIPPED_LOCKED` mapping) are unit-tested by constructing shift `scheduled_start` relative to a frozen `Date.now`.
- **SQL / gateway side** — the gateway/RPC reads `NOW()`, which a unit cannot mock. Instead **seed `scheduled_start` relative to real `now()`**: a shift "3h out" is `create_test_shift('S5', 0, …)` with the row's `scheduled_start` `UPDATE`d to `now() + interval '3 hours'`; a shift "safely out" uses `now() + interval '30 hours'`. pgTAP asserts the RPC returns `SHIFT_TIME_LOCKED` / proceeds accordingly. (Do **not** mutate the DB clock; relative-to-`now()` seeding is deterministic and parallel-safe.)

### 0.4 Seeding FSM states with the existing baseline helper

The baseline ships `public.create_test_shift(p_state text, p_days_ahead int, p_employee_id uuid DEFAULT NULL)` ([baseline:5203](../../supabase/migrations/20251015000000_baseline_schema.sql#L5203)) which inserts a shift directly in a canonical S-state into the `__TEST_STATE_MACHINE__` roster, and `cleanup_test_shifts()` ([baseline:4386](../../supabase/migrations/20251015000000_baseline_schema.sql#L4386)) to tear down. **Supported states: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S15** (verified in the `CASE`). Conventions for this plan:

- **Open-for-bidding** shifts = `create_test_shift('S5', d)` (`on_bidding_normal`) and `create_test_shift('S6', d)` (`on_bidding_urgent`) — the only two states where `select_winner` is legal.
- The helper does **not** insert `shift_bids` — each test inserts its own pending bids against the returned `shift_id` so the winner-pending rule (Fix 3 / §3.3) and qual/role data are controllable.
- Already-assigned = `S4`, cancelled = `S15`, bidding-closed = `S8` — these drive the FSM-illegal negative cases (Fix 1 / §3.1).
- TTS variants: take the helper's shift_id then `UPDATE shifts SET scheduled_start = now() + interval '<n> hours'` (see §0.3).
- For swaps: build two `S4` shifts assigned to two different employees, insert a `shift_swaps` row, then drive it to `MANAGER_PENDING` via `sm_accept_trade` ([swaps.api.ts:853](../../src/modules/planning/swapping/api/swaps.api.ts#L853)) so the enqueue trigger fires for real (IS-/CC- integration cases).
- Every integration/pgTAP test wraps its body so `cleanup_test_shifts()` (and explicit `DELETE` of seeded `shift_bids`/`shift_swaps`/`assignment_*`/`swap_*`) runs in teardown; pgTAP tests run inside a `BEGIN; … ROLLBACK;` where isolation allows.

### 0.5 Determinism contract (applies to every unit case)

Per [01 §4.4](01-auto-assign-bids-refactor.md) the brain is a pure function with a total tie-break order (`composite_score` desc → `bid_time` asc → `bid_id` asc). **Every unit test asserting selection runs the engine twice on the same input and asserts byte-identical output** (`expect(run()).toEqual(run())`) in addition to its value assertion. This is the structural guard against the "two lineages" drift the audit warns about (§1).

### 0.6 Priority tags

P0 = correctness/safety blocker (must pass before any auto action is trusted in prod). P1 = SSoT/audit/scale. P2 = optimization/fancy fairness/queue fan-out. Tags are per-group in each section header and per-row where a row diverges from its group.

## 3. Unit — Swap eligibility engine, per-rule × modes  (`SE-*`)  **[P0–P1]**

Targets `evaluateEligibility(ctx, policy)` ([02 §3](02-auto-approve-swaps.md)) — a deterministic pure function. Each row asserts a rule's `status` and the `mode→vote` mapping (REQUIRE_EQUAL/AUTO_REJECT_IF_FAIL→rejectVote; ROUTE_TO_REVIEW_IF_FAIL→reviewVote; IGNORE→none). Always-on rules force `AUTO_REJECT_IF_FAIL` and cannot be configured away.

## 5. Integration — Auto-Assign run end-to-end via gateway, dry-run, rollback  (`IA-*`)  **[P0–P1]**

Runs against the Supabase **test branch**. Seeds via `create_test_shift` + bid inserts; invokes `auto-assign-bids`; asserts on `shifts.version`/state, `assignment_runs`/`assignment_decisions`/`assignment_events`, `shift_events`, `shift_bids`.

| ID | Title | Given / Precondition | Action | Expected | Maps-to |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| IA-01 | Happy path single shift commit via gateway | 1 `S5` shift (TTS 30h), 2 pending bids | POST `auto-assign-bids` | winner ASSIGNED via `sm_apply_shift_op('select_winner')`; shift v 7→8, S4; loser bid `rejected`; `assignment_decisions` row; `shift_events` idem row | 01 §2.4 / §5.5 / Fix 1,3,7,9 |

## 6. Integration — Auto-Approve queue → decide → commit, shadow, override, revert  (`IS-*`)  **[P0–P1]**

Seeds two `S4` shifts + a `shift_swaps` row driven to `MANAGER_PENDING` via `sm_accept_trade` (fires `trg_enqueue_swap_auto_decision` for real). Invokes `auto-approve-swaps`; asserts on `swap_review_queue`, `swap_decisions`, `swap_audit_log`, shift state, notifications.

| ID | Title | Given / Precondition | Action | Expected | Maps-to |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| IS-01 | Enqueue on MANAGER_PENDING (transactional outbox) | offer accepted | `sm_accept_trade` | exactly one `swap_review_queue` row (PENDING) per version-tuple; `swap_audit_log 'ENQUEUED'` | 02 §1.1 / §2.1 S2.1 |

| IS-03 | AUTO_REJECT reverts both shifts to NoTrade | always-on rule fail | worker tick | `reject_trade` runs; both shifts `trading_status=NoTrade`; swap REJECTED | 02 §2.2 / audit#26 |
| IS-04 | MANUAL_REVIEW sets review_flag, stays pending | ROUTE rule failed | worker tick | `review_flag=true`, swap stays MANAGER_PENDING, no shift change | 02 §2.2 / audit#27 |
| IS-05 | Shadow mode: decide + log, no shift change | `shadow_mode=true`, would-be APPROVE | worker tick | `swap_decisions(shadow=true,committed=false)`; shift unchanged; queue DONE | 02 §2.1 P2 / audit#30 |

## 7. Concurrency — version-CAS races, two managers, auto+manual, withdrawal, dup delivery, SKIP LOCKED, deadlock  (`CC-*`)  **[P0]**

Real Postgres; two sessions race inside pgTAP / two parallel `functions.invoke`. These are the structural correctness gates.

| ID | Title | Given / Precondition | Action | Expected | Maps-to |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| CC-01 | Two managers auto-assign same shift | two runs target one `S5` shift v=7 | concurrent `select_winner` exp=7 | first APPLIED v=8; second `VERSION_CONFLICT`; no overwrite | 01 §5.6 / audit#1 |
| CC-02 | Auto vs manual assign race | auto run + manual `selectBidWinnerViaGateway` same shift | concurrent | one wins, other CAS-fails; no dangling accepted bid | Fix 7 / audit#2 |
| CC-03 | Withdrawal mid-flight | bid withdrawn between snapshot read and gateway commit | run | gateway `WINNER_NOT_PENDING`; no revival | Fix 3 / audit#4 / FSM 5.3 |
| CC-04 | Duplicate auto-assign delivery (double-click) | same run, same shift, two invocations | re-invoke | idem uuid → one write, IDEMPOTENT_REPLAY; `UNIQUE(run_id,shift_id)` blocks 2nd decision | Fix 8 / audit#10,#35 |
| CC-05 | Duplicate swap queue delivery | same `idempotency_key` delivered twice | two ticks | single commit; second IDEMPOTENT_REPLAY | 02 §1.2 / audit#35 |
| CC-06 | Two swaps share a shift | swapX and swapY both touch shift Z | concurrent decide | one commits, other CAS-fails → re-queue/re-eval | 02 §6.8 / audit#36 |
| CC-07 | Drift between eval and commit (swap) | offered shift version changes after eval | worker commit | gateway `VERSION_CONFLICT`; requeue; new key → clean re-eval | 02 §1.3 / audit#37 |
| CC-08 | SKIP LOCKED claim isolation | 2 workers, N PENDING queue rows | concurrent claim | each row claimed by exactly one worker (no double-claim) | 02 §1.1 (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`) / audit#44 |
| CC-09 | Stale-claim lease reclaim | worker claims then "crashes" (no DONE) past lease | second worker | row reclaimable after lease timeout; eventually processed | 02 §1.2 (locked_by/locked_at) / audit#48,#49 |
| CC-10 | Deadlock-free lock ordering (bids) | two overlapping runs, multiple shifts | concurrent commits | both lock in `shift_id ASC` order → no cycle, no deadlock | 01 §5.4 |
| CC-11 | Single-row lock only (no multi-row hold) | a `select_winner` commit | inspect locks | exactly one `shifts` row `FOR UPDATE`; lock held microseconds | 01 §5.2/§5.4 |
| CC-12 | Concurrent manual approve + auto (swap) | manager approves while worker decides same swap | concurrent | one wins; audit consistent; no double approve | audit#39 |
| CC-13 | VERSION_CONFLICT envelope used without extra round-trip | conflict | retry wrapper (live) | `current_version`/`current_state` read from envelope; retry uses them | 01 §5.3 |
| CC-14 | Run-level recovery after worker crash mid-loop | crash after some commits | resume run | resumes from cursor; committed shifts not redone; no partial corruption | 01 §2.5/§5.1 / audit#28(swap),#15 |

## 8. Security — authz, RLS, forged actor, SECURITY DEFINER boundary, abuse  (`SEC-*`)  **[P0]**

Cert-based authz (`app_access_certificates`, `access_level ∈ gamma/delta/epsilon/zeta`, `is_active=true`, manager col `user_id` — `is_manager_or_above()` is BROKEN, [00 §8](00-contracts-and-conventions.md)).

## 12. Six concrete example test bodies

> Patterns only — file paths are the intended homes. The TS examples follow the repo's existing vitest style ([shift-op-legality.test.ts](../../src/modules/rosters/domain/__tests__/shift-op-legality.test.ts), [bidding-urgency.test.ts](../../src/modules/rosters/domain/__tests__/bidding-urgency.test.ts)); the pgTAP example introduces `supabase/tests/`.

### 12.1 CAS race test (CC-01) — pgTAP, two sessions race one shift

```sql

### 12.2 Idempotency test (CC-04 / MF-22) — vitest, replay is a no-op

```ts
// supabase/functions/auto-assign-bids/__tests__/idempotency.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, beforeAll } from 'vitest';
import { svc, seedOpenShiftWithBids, getShift } from './_helpers'; // service-role client + seeders

      body: { scope: { organization_id: ORG }, dry_run: false, options: { max_wins_per_employee: 3 } },
    });
    runId = r1.data.run_id;
    const afterFirst = await getShift(shiftId);          // version bumped once, S4

### 12.3 Fail-closed test (DM-19 / FR-06) — vitest, solver throw → MANUAL_REVIEW

```ts

import { describe, it, expect, vi } from 'vitest';
import { decideSwap } from '../engine';                  // pure orchestration entry

### 12.4 Fairness determinism test (AU-12) — vitest, identical input → identical output

```ts
// src/modules/compliance/v8/orchestrator/bidding/__tests__/determinism.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { runBidSelection } from '../index';

    expect(a.selected_bids[0].bid_id <= a.selected_bids[1].bid_id).toBe(true);

});
```

### 12.5 Eligibility always-on test (SE-07) — vitest, cert cannot be disabled

```ts

```

### 12.6 Rollback-safety test (FR-09 / IA-10) — vitest integration, edited-since is skipped

```ts
// supabase/functions/auto-assign-bids/__tests__/rollback-safety.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect, beforeAll } from 'vitest';
import { svc, runAutoAssign, bumpShiftVersion, getShift } from './_helpers';

    // simulate a manual edit on one assigned shift AFTER the run → version drift
    await bumpShiftVersion(editedShift);                    // version != recorded version_after

    const kept = await getShift(editedShift);
    expect(kept.assignment_status).toBe('assigned');       // drift protected by CAS, not unwound

    // audit preserved (FR-11): decisions still present, run flagged ROLLED_BACK
    const { count } = await svc.from('assignment_decisions')
      .select('*', { count: 'exact', head: true }).eq('run_id', runId);
    expect(count).toBe(2);

```

## 13. Execution & gating

- **CI gate (every PR touching these workstreams):** `npm run type-check` (`tsc --noEmit`, 0 errors) + `npm run test` (all `AU/MF/SE/DM` unit cases) + `npm run build`. ESLint is intentionally excluded (broken — project memory). This mirrors the existing `"verify"` script ([package.json](../../package.json)).
- **Pre-merge integration gate:** `IA/IS/CC/SEC` against an ephemeral Supabase **branch** (created/torn down per CI run via `create_branch`/`delete_branch`), with the two Edge Functions deployed to it. pgTAP via `pg_prove supabase/tests/*.sql`.
- **Nightly / pre-release:** `LS/FR` against a prod-sized branch; capture p95, drain time, DLQ rate as the [02 §7](02-auto-approve-swaps.md) shadow-promotion gate evidence.
- **Promotion blockers (must be green before `shadow_mode=false`):** all P0 (`AU`, `MF`, `SE`, `DM`, `CC`, `SEC`) green; LS-03 (p95<2s), LS-07 (DLQ<1%), FR-01/02/06 green; shadow-vs-human agreement ≥95% (a separate analytics check, not a unit test).
