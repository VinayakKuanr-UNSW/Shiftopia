# Auto-Assign Bids Refactor + Auto-Approve Swaps — Implementation Plan (Index)

**Date:** 2026-06-23 · **Mode:** Implementation architecture (the audit is in [AUDIT.md](AUDIT.md); this set moves from findings to a buildable plan).

This is a multi-document plan. Read [00-contracts-and-conventions.md](00-contracts-and-conventions.md) first — it is **binding** (canonical names, the gateway contract, idempotency formats, enums, P0/P1/P2 convention) and the other docs depend on it.

> **Draft migrations are NOT in `supabase/migrations/`.** Prod is live; a human promotes drafts via the expand/contract sequence in [04 §3](04-backlog-rollout-deployment.md). The draft SQL passed a structural lint (balanced dollar-quotes, tables/functions/triggers/policies present) but has **not** been executed against a database.

## The architecture in one paragraph

**One write path, one decision brain per feature, server-side, fail-closed.** Every assignment/swap mutation goes through the already-hardened `sm_apply_shift_op` gateway (optimistic version-CAS + canonical `get_shift_fsm_state`/`fsm_op_is_legal` guard + `shift_events` sourcing). Auto-Assign's two divergent engines collapse into a single server-side Edge Function (`auto-assign-bids`) that hosts the pure `runBidSelection` decision model and commits each winner through the gateway's `select_winner` op; the client decision loop is deleted. Auto-Approve Swaps is a new event-driven Edge worker (`auto-approve-swaps`) that reuses the existing `runSwapGuards` + `swapEvaluator` and commits via the gateway's `approve_trade`/`reject_trade` ops, shipping in shadow mode first. Both record an immutable, idempotent decision + audit row and support admin rollback/revert.

## Final opinionated decisions (no alternatives)

- **D1** All assignment/swap writes route through `sm_apply_shift_op`. `sm_select_bid_winner` is hardened transitionally, then dropped (04 M8).
- **D2** Auto-Assign = **merge** both engines into one **Edge Function** running the ported `runBidSelection` brain; client loop deleted. (Edge, not PG function, because the TS compliance engine cannot run in Postgres.)
- **D3** Auto-Approve Swaps = event-driven Edge worker, **shadow-first**, reusing the existing solver + guards + gateway. No new rule engine.
- **D4** Idempotency on every automated decision (formats in 00 §5). **D5** Fail closed on any engine/guard error.

## Execution order (from 04 §6)

- **Sprint 1 — P0 safety floor:** harden the write path (E1) + assignment audit tables (E3) before any automated commit is trusted. This alone closes the audit's Critical/High data-integrity findings (double-assign, ghost-assign, withdrawn-revival, window-lock bypass, qual bypass).
- **Sprint 2–3 — P1:** server-side Auto-Assign engine (E2) + fairness (E4) + swap policy/queue/worker in shadow (E5/E6).
- **Sprint 4–5 — P1/P2:** abuse prevention (E7), observability (E8), admin UI (E9), staged rollout + contract migration (E10).

Total estimate (04 §2): **~178.5 dev-days**, ~5 two-week sprints with 2 BE / 1 FE / 1 DB-leaning BE / 1 QA; critical path is the Auto-Assign Edge engine chain (E2 → cutover → rollback → contract-drop).

## Open items for the human reviewer

1. Promote draft migrations only after executing them against a Supabase **branch/test** project (they are unrun). Honor the `ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE` split rule (04 §3).
2. Confirm `app_access_certificates.organization_id` exists for the swap policy RLS (02 assumption); else join through `profiles`.
3. Confirm `sm_approve_peer_swap` is symmetric for the swap-revert inverse reassignment (02 assumption).
4. **Edge worker deployment — corrected approach (verified 2026-06-24).** Both Edge workers (`auto-assign-bids`, `auto-approve-swaps`) were scaffolded to *vendor* the v8 TS compliance engine into Deno. That is the wrong grain: **no existing Edge Function vendors the engine** — the deployed `evaluate-compliance` + `autoschedule-*` functions delegate to **DB RPCs** (`check_shift_overlap`, `calculate_weekly_hours`, `validate_rest_period`, `check_shift_compliance`). Deno is also not installed here, so a vendored bundle can't be verified. **Before deploying either worker**, refactor its compliance integration to call `evaluate-compliance` over HTTP (per bidder / per swap-party) instead of importing `@compliance/...` — see each function's README "⚠️ DEPLOYMENT STATUS" section. The pure `eligibility.ts`/`decision-matrix.ts` (tested) and all DB RPCs are unaffected. None of this blocks the **live** P0 safety fixes, which are already in prod and protect the current client paths.
